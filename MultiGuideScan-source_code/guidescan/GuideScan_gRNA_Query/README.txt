#GuideScan_db_target_sequence_parse.sh
This script takes a GuideScan BAM file database and generates a test file with all complementary gRNA target sequences present in the file

#gRNA_lookup_serialization_GuideScan_db.py
This script runs on the file produced by GuideScan_db_target_sequence_parse.sh and it creates a pickle that allows for the fast query of a given gRNA's inclusion in the GuideScan database

#gRNA_lookup_query_GuideScan_db.py
This script deserializes the pickle(s) generated by gRNA_lookup_serialization_GuideScan_db.py and determines if a file of gRNAs complementary regions are found in a GuideScan database
